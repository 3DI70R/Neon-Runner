# Pocketsprite-Game-Test
Test project with me trying to implement game from scratch using C++

I studied C++ a ~5 years ago and didn't used it since then, so please don't take any code from this repo as reference, it most likely not optimal.

I dont even decided what game this will be, just finishing basic stuff for now (rendering, game loop, etc).
